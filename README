INSTALLATION

    1. Building

    Build the radio plugin by typing

        make

    If you have gkrellm installed in a nonstandard location, you need
    to change the GKRELLMDIR variable in the Makefile.

    If you want to use LIRC (http://www.lirc.org/) with the radio 
    plugin, you just need to define the WITH_LIRC variable to a 
    non-empty value. For example in bash you could do:
    
    	WITH_LIRC=1 make

    If you want to use i18n support compile with
      enable_nls=1 make 
    And install with 
      enable_nls=1 make install

    2. Installing

    Copy the file radio.so to your GKrellM plugin directory. This
    could be /usr/lib/gkrellm2/plugins. If you don't have write
    access, you can put the file in ~/.gkrellm2/plugins/ instead.


USAGE

    The radio plugin consists of a text field to the left and a
    button to the right.

    The button on the right will turn the radio on or off.

    Clicking the text field will tune to the next channel. You can
    configure channels in the GKrellM configuration dialogs, under
    "Plugins/Radio Plugin".

    Clicking the right mouse bottun somewhere on the plugin, will open 
    a menu with preset channels.

    If you have a wheel on your mouse, your can use it to tune to
    any frequence. Simply place it over the plugin and scroll!
